  <p>This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at https://www.w3.org/TR/.

This specification is a Superseded Recommendation. A newer specification exists that is recommended for new adoption in place of this specification.

This document was published by the Web Platform Working Group that would obsolete the HTML 5.1 Recommendation.

All interested parties are invited to provide implementation and bug reports and other comments through the Working Group's Issue tracker. These will generally be considered in the development of HTML 5.3.

The implementation report produced for this version demonstrates that in almost every case changes are matched by interoperable implementation.

For purposes of the W3C Patent Policy, this Superseded Recommendation has the same status as an active Recommendation; it retains licensing commitments and remains available as a reference for old -- and possibly still deployed -- implementations, but is not recommended for future implementation. New implementations should follow the latest version of the HTML 5.2 specification.

This document was produced by a group operating under the W3C Patent Policy.

An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.
